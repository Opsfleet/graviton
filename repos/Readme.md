# Repositories Overview

This repository contains two sub-folders, each representing an individual Git repository. Each of these repositories includes a simple HTTP REST API.

## Included Files

Each repository includes the following files:

- `buildspec.yaml`: This file contains the build specification for AWS CodeBuild. It defines the build process for your application.

- `manifest_buildspec.yaml`: This file is used to create multi-architecture builds. It specifies the architectures for which the build should be created.

## Purpose

These repositories are designed to provide a basic structure for developing and deploying HTTP REST APIs with multi-architecture support.
