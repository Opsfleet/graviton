# Unlocking the Power of Graviton: Migrating AWS Container Workloads

## Demo Overview

This repository provides all the necessary resources to replicate the demo presented in our webinar. It's designed to guide you through the process of migrating your AWS container workloads to Graviton.

The repository is organized into three main directories:

- `k8s`: This directory contains Helm values files and Kubernetes manifests, which are essential for setting up and configuring your Kubernetes environment.

- `Repos`: This directory includes the content to be committed to the two Git repositories used in the demo. These repositories contain the source code for the applications deployed during the demo.

- `Terraform`: This directory contains Infrastructure as Code (IaC) scripts written in Terraform. These scripts automate the process of setting up and configuring your cloud infrastructure on AWS.

By following the instructions and using the resources provided in this repository, you can easily replicate the demo and learn how to migrate your own AWS container workloads to Graviton.
